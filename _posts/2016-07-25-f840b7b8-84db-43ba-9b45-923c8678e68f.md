# Using signs to learn a language

To teach a new language one needs to get comfortable with its words and syntax. And the fastest way to learn is to be submerged in a language that way there is no escape from using it. of course when you do not life in the country of the language you are learning you need to find an alternative. That alternative can be using signs, using signs learning a language give you a whole body experience if you will. next to using the signs you should not be too precise on the meaning, so if you are talking about sitting you can do that on a chair, a bench or a fotuille. all these are used are sitting and as time passes and the exposure to the language becomes greater the language will become more proficient. that means that words that used will be more accurate when used and words used for the thing you can sit on will be more accurate.
